# HTangl Firmware

This is an edited version of the HayBox firmware created by [Haystack](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack)

Many features have been removed/added/modified to make the firmware more 
straightforward to use on HTangl controllers as well as the DIDIY.

Full guide coming soon, please go to the [HTangl Discord](https://discord.gg/yAeFsbCDpv) if you need help using this firmware

## DIDIY V0 owners ##

To update your board go to the [releases section](https://github.com/HTangl/HTangl-Firmware/releases) and download the "DIDIY-V0.uf2" file by clicking on it.  
Plug your controller into your computer while holding the C-Right button, a new drive should show up called "RPI-RP2".  
Drag and drop the uf2 file onto that drive, it will immediately disconnect and then reconnect, the drive will disappear and your controller will be updated.
