# HTangl Firmware

This is an edited version of the HayB0XX firmware created by [Haystack](https://github.com/JonnyHaystack)

HayB0XX is a modular custom firmware for [B0XX](https://b0xx.com) style
controllers powered by 16MHz AVR microcontrollers. It was originally
based on Crane's
[DIYB0XX/GCCPCB code](https://github.com/Crane1195/GCCPCB/tree/master/code),
Haystack rewrote the code and made things much more maintainable and extensible.

Many features have been removed/added/modified to make the firmware more 
straightforward to use on HTangl controllers.
